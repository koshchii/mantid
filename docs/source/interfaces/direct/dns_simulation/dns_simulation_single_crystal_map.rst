The **Single Crystal Map** tab displays the results of the simulation in the horizontal
scattering plane, with **hkl1** as x-axis and **hkl2_p** as y-axis.
The coverage of a scan will be shown, if the **Omega Offset** has been fixed and
**det_rot** and **sample_rot** start and endpoints were provided. The **Simulate**
button will update the plot. The reflections are indexed and their intensities
are displayed on the plot. By hovering with the mouse over the crystal map one can
see the corresponding hkl values under the **Simulate** button.
