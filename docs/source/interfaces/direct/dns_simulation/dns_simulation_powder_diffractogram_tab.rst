Once the reflection table has been evaluated, the simulation of powder diffraction
will be displayed under the **Powder Diffractogram** tab. The displayed angular range
can be varied (within the values accessible by DNS) with the help of **Start** and
**End** fields in the **det_rot** box of the **Powder Diffractogram**. There is also
a possibility to set a zero angular shift in the corresponding field of this box.
The **Simulate** button should be used to update the plot and one can use a **Labels**
checkbox in order to choose if to dispay the Miller indices of the corrresponding
peaks.
